// This file will be significantly reduced or removed.
// Service stubs might return minimal mock data for development if needed,
// but components should not import from here directly anymore.

// export const mockBooks: Book[] = [ ... ] // Remove
// export const mockReviews: Review[] = [ ... ] // Remove
// export const mockBookLists: BookList[] = [ ... ] // Remove
// export const mockUserDiary: DiaryEntry[] = [ ... ] // Remove
// ... and so on for all mock data arrays.

// It's okay to keep this file empty or with a comment explaining its previous purpose.
// For now, I'll leave it empty. Future service stubs might temporarily create small mocks internally if needed.
